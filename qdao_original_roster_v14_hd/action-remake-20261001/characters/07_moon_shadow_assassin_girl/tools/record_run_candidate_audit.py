 'E':'Near right support progresses from front to under-body, rear drive and extended terminal forefoot in01-08; far left in09-16. E heel-to-toe axis retained. Edited04/12 re-establish under-body load;06-08/14-16 extend calf instead of folding prematurely. Both hands and daggers retained.',
 'S':'Front-view toe axes face camera. A screen-right leg supports first half, B screen-left second. Rear toe contacts in05-08/13-16 read higher on screen due depth; paired edits extend shins and keep the opposite front boot raised/sole exposed. No forced same-y grounding.',
 'N':'Back-view heels stay aligned north. Screen-right support first half and screen-left second. N06-v2 connects05 through07-08 at comparable rear depth; each calf remains extended while opposite leg is folded for forward swing.',
 'NE':'Right support first half and left second. NE07-v2 removes former lateral return between06 and08. Knees, calves and forefoot follow the NE track. Raised rear heel can expose sole; that alone does not imply flight.',
 'W':'Left-facing boots follow W throughout.04/12 retain underbody support;05-08 and13-16 extend the original support behind while opposite knee/boot swings forward. W04-v2 and07-v2 selected; no added ground line visible.',
 'NW':'New01 heel/toe landing agrees with02 at front depth. Left support through08 and right through16.06/07-v2 preserve correct leg instead of crossed/misassigned rejects.07 has16-23px lowest-pixel variation relative to neighbors; this is not a sole-contact measurement. Reviewed extended calf and forefoot orientation, not mechanically aligned lowest pixels.',
 'SW':'First-half screen-left rear support continues from05 through06-v2 and07/08-v2; raised heel/extended ankle make the forefoot read down the SW axis. Large front boot remains the opposite swing leg. Second-half14-16 retain opposite support, with gradually extended rear leg. Both hands keep their daggers; no outward boot yaw.'}
